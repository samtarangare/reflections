How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- Seperate branch is require if are working on completely different/new feature. The benefits is that if we think the feature has come out properly we can merge with master and if not we can always get rid of that branch. Branches also helps us to collaborate works with other memebers easily.
